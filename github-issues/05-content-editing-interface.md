# Issue: Implement Content Editing and Management Interface

## üè∑Ô∏è Labels
`enhancement`, `frontend`, `ui/ux`, `content-management`, `high-priority`

## üìã Summary
Users cannot edit generated content after creation. The video detail page shows stub implementations for Reports, Flashcards, and Ideas tabs. Content cards have edit menu items that don't function. This creates a poor user experience where users are stuck with initial AI-generated content.

## üîç Problem Description
**Current Issues:**
- Video detail page tabs show "will be implemented soon" placeholders (lines 139-156 in `/client/src/pages/video-detail.tsx`)
- `ReportCard` and `FlashcardSetCard` components have non-functional edit buttons
- No way to modify AI-generated content to improve quality
- Users must regenerate entire content sets instead of making small edits

**Expected User Workflow:**
1. User views generated content
2. User identifies content that needs improvement
3. User clicks edit to modify content inline or in modal
4. User saves changes and sees updated content immediately

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Shared editing components
interface EditableContent {
  id: number;
  type: 'report' | 'flashcard' | 'idea';
  content: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

// Editor component props
interface ContentEditorProps {
  content: EditableContent;
  onSave: (updated: EditableContent) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
  onDelete?: () => Promise<void>;
  readOnly?: boolean;
}
```

### Rich Text Editor Integration
```typescript
// Consider using react-quill or similar for rich text editing
import ReactQuill from 'react-quill';

const modules = {
  toolbar: [
    ['bold', 'italic', 'underline'],
    ['link', 'blockquote', 'code-block'],
    [{ 'list': 'ordered'}, { 'list': 'bullet' }],
    ['clean']
  ],
};
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Use TanStack Query mutations for updates
const useUpdateReport = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (report: UpdateReportRequest) => 
      api.put(`/api/reports/${report.id}`, report),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['reports']);
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['videos']);
    },
  });
};
```

### Form Validation
```typescript
// Use Zod schemas for validation
const reportEditSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, 'Title is required').max(200),
  content: z.string().min(10, 'Content too short'),
  type: z.enum(['medium', 'linkedin']),
});
```

- Related to: Export and sharing functionality

## üí° Implementation Notes

### Auto-save Strategy
- Debounce save operations (500ms delay)
- Show save status indicator
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Recover unsaved changes on page reload

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load rich text editor components
- Virtualize large lists of content items
- Implement proper memoization for expensive operations
- Use React.memo for frequently re-rendered components

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback for all actions
- Implement keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+Z for undo)
- Show character limits for platforms with restrictions
- Provide templates or suggestions for improvements

### Error Handling
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Show specific error messages for validation failures
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed saves
- Maintain local state during error recovery

## üß™ Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test inline editing functionality
- [ ] Test modal/dialog editing interfaces
- [ ] Test auto-save behavior
- [ ] Test form validation and error states
- [ ] Test with large content datasets
- [ ] Test concurrent editing scenarios
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Accessibility testing for all editing interfaces
