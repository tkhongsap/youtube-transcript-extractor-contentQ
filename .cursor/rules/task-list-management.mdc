# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists to track project progress for the **OCR Document Extraction Application** (deployed on Replit).

## Creating Task Lists

1. **Use Markdown Files**  
   - Create one or more `.md` files (e.g., `TASKS.md`, `FEATURE_TASKS.md`) in your project root or a dedicated `docs/` folder.  
   - Name the files descriptively based on each phase or feature set (e.g., `OCR_TASKS.md`, `UI_TASKS.md`).

2. **Recommended Structure Within Each Task File**

   ```markdown
   # [Feature or Project Phase Name]

   A brief description of the purpose and overall goal of the tasks in this file.

   ## Completed Tasks
   - [x] Brief description of tasks already finished  
     (e.g., “Initialized Node.js/React project on Replit,” “Set up MongoDB schema for Document model.”)

   ## In Progress Tasks
   - [ ] Brief description of tasks currently being worked on  
     (e.g., “Implement file upload endpoint with Multer,” “Connect to OpenAI Vision API and parse responses.”)

   ## Upcoming Tasks
   - [ ] Brief description of tasks to do next  
     (e.g., “Set up the review page for extracted OCR data,” “Add error handling for low-confidence handwriting.”)
