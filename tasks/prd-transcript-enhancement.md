# Product Requirements Document: Transcript Enhancement Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Transcript Enhancement feature allows users to add supplementary text to automatically generated video transcripts. This addresses the common problem of transcript inaccuracies and missing context, enabling users to create more complete and accurate transcripts for better downstream content generation (summaries, reports, etc.).

**Goal:** Improve transcript quality by allowing users to add additional context and corrections, resulting in better AI-generated summaries and reports.

## Goals

1. **Improve Transcript Accuracy:** Enable users to supplement auto-generated transcripts with missing or corrected information
2. **Enhance Content Quality:** Provide richer source material for AI summarization and report generation
3. **Simple User Experience:** Offer an intuitive way to add contextual information without complex editing workflows
4. **Maintain Source Integrity:** Preserve the original transcript while clearly marking user additions

## User Stories

- **As a content creator**, I want to add missing context to my video transcripts so that AI-generated summaries include important details that weren't clearly captured in the audio.

- **As a meeting organizer**, I want to supplement meeting transcripts with additional notes so that the final reports are more comprehensive and accurate.

- **As a researcher**, I want to add clarifying information to interview transcripts so that subsequent analysis and summaries are more meaningful.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Additional Text Input:** The system must provide a text area where users can add supplementary content to any transcript.

2. **Visual Distinction:** The system must clearly distinguish between original transcript text and user-added text through different formatting (e.g., different colors, fonts, or background highlighting).

3. **Flexible Placement:** Users must be able to add additional text at any point during the transcript editing process.

4. **Content Preservation:** The system must maintain both the original transcript and the enhanced version with additional text.

5. **Downstream Integration:** The enhanced transcript (original + additional text) must be used for all subsequent AI processing (summaries, reports, etc.).

6. **Save Functionality:** The system must automatically save additional text as users type or provide manual save options.

7. **Clear Labeling:** Additional text sections must be clearly labeled (e.g., "Additional Notes" or "User Added").

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Inline editing of the original transcript text
- Real-time collaboration on transcript editing
- Version history or change tracking
- Advanced text formatting options (bold, italics, etc.)
- Integration with external note-taking applications
- Automatic spell-check or grammar correction for added text

## Design Considerations

- **Layout:** Display additional text in clearly marked sections adjacent to or below the original transcript
- **Styling:** Use contrasting colors or backgrounds to distinguish user-added content
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the interface works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility:** Maintain proper color contrast and screen reader compatibility

## Technical Considerations

- Store additional text separately from original transcript data
- Implement text merging logic for downstream AI processing
- Consider character limits for additional text to prevent performance issues
- Ensure proper data validation and sanitization for user input

## Success Metrics

1. **Usage Adoption:** 30% of users who view transcripts also add additional text within the first month
2. **Content Quality:** 20% improvement in user satisfaction ratings for AI-generated summaries and reports
3. **Engagement:** Increased time spent on transcript pages by 25%
4. **Feature Completion:** 80% of users who start adding additional text complete the action

## Open Questions

1. Should there be a character limit for additional text sections?
2. Do we need to provide formatting options (bullet points, line breaks) for additional text?
3. Should additional text be included in search functionality across transcripts?
4. How should we handle additional text in transcript exports or sharing features?
