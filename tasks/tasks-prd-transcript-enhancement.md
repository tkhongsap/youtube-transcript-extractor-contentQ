# Task List: Transcript Enhancement Feature

Based on PRD: `prd-transcript-enhancement.md`

## Relevant Files

- `components/TranscriptEnhancement.tsx` - Main component for the transcript enhancement UI
- `components/TranscriptEnhancement.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the transcript enhancement component
- `components/AdditionalTextInput.tsx` - Component for the additional text input area
- `components/AdditionalTextInput.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the additional text input component
- `lib/transcriptService.ts` - Service for handling transcript data and enhancement logic
- `lib/transcriptService.test.ts` - Unit tests for transcript service
- `types/transcript.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for transcript and enhancement data
- `styles/transcriptEnhancement.css` - Styling for visual distinction between original and added text
- `hooks/useTranscriptEnhancement.ts` - Custom hook for managing transcript enhancement state
- `hooks/useTranscriptEnhancement.test.ts` - Unit tests for the enhancement hook

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- Consider the existing codebase structure when implementing these files
