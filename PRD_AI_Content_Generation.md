# PRD: AI-Generated Content Tabs with User-Controlled Generation

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of AI-powered content generation tabs for Content Spark. The feature enables users to generate summaries, reports, flashcards, and ideas from video transcripts through explicit user actions, optimizing computing costs while providing persistent, high-quality content.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State**: Users can enhance transcripts with additional text, but cannot generate AI-powered content derivatives.

**Pain Points**:
- No way to create summaries, reports, flashcards, or ideas from processed videos
- Computing costs could spiral without user control
- Generated content needs to persist across sessions
- Users want control over when AI processing occurs

**Opportunity**: Provide user-controlled AI content generation with cost management and session persistence.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Enable AI-powered content generation from enhanced transcripts
- Implement cost-effective, user-controlled LLM usage
- Provide persistent content storage across sessions
- Maintain intuitive tabbed interface

### Success Metrics
- User engagement: 70%+ of users generate at least one content type
- Cost efficiency: <$0.50 average AI cost per video processing
- Persistence: 95%+ content retention across sessions
- User satisfaction: 4.5+ rating for content quality

## 4. User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Persona: Content Creators
**Background**: YouTubers, educators, marketers creating derivative content
**Goals**: Transform long-form videos into multiple content formats
**Pain Points**: Manual content creation takes hours

### Secondary Persona: Students & Researchers
**Background**: Learning from educational videos and lectures
**Goals**: Create study materials and reference content
**Pain Points**: Note-taking and summarization inefficiency

### Use Cases
1. **Content Repurposing**: Creator generates LinkedIn post from 2-hour podcast
2. **Study Material Creation**: Student creates flashcards from lecture video
3. **Content Ideation**: Marketer mines blog ideas from industry discussions
4. **Report Generation**: Analyst creates summary report from conference talk

## 5. User Journey Options

### Option A: Progressive Disclosure (Recommended)
```
1. User lands on video detail page
2. Sees tabs: [Transcript] [Summary] [Reports] [Flashcards] [Ideas]
3. Transcript tab shows enhanced transcript (already generated)
4. Other tabs show "Generate [Content Type]" button with preview info
5. User clicks generate → AI processes → Content displays with edit options
6. Generated content persists; button changes to "Regenerate"
```

**Pros**: Clear cost control, intuitive progression, prevents accidental generation
**Cons**: Requires multiple clicks for users wanting all content types

### Option B: Batch Generation
```
1. User sees tabs with checkboxes: "Generate Summary ☐ Reports ☐ Flashcards ☐ Ideas ☐"
2. User selects desired content types
3. Single "Generate Selected Content" button
4. AI processes all selected types in one operation
5. Progress indicator shows generation status for each type
```

**Pros**: Efficient for users wanting multiple content types, batch processing
**Cons**: Higher single-session costs, less granular control

### Option C: Smart Defaults with Override
```
1. System auto-generates Summary (low cost, high value)
2. Other tabs show preview + "Generate Full Content" button
3. User can configure default generation preferences
4. One-click regeneration for all or selective content
```

**Pros**: Immediate value, customizable, balances automation with control
**Cons**: Some automated costs, complexity in preference management

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Tab Organization
- **FR-1**: Transcript tab must be first in tab order
- **FR-2**: Tab order: Transcript → Summary → Reports → Flashcards → Ideas
